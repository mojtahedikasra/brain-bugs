    <h2 class="reveal">For over 15 years, I've had a front-row seat to how smart people make costly mistakes.</h2>

    <p class="reveal">
      As a Partner at one of the world's largest consulting and accounting firms, I've spent my career in the trenches of corporate transformation — leading enterprise restructurings, mergers, technology implementations, and large-scale strategy initiatives across industries, government institutions, and NGOs.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      I'm a CPA, a technologist, a venture investor, and a senior advisor who has built teams, businesses, and guided some of the most complex organizational changes at the highest levels. Through all of it, one thing has become undeniably clear: <strong>the biggest risk in any room isn't the strategy — it's the psychology.</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      I've watched brilliant executives fall into the sunk cost trap. I've seen seasoned leaders paralyzed by analysis paralysis. I've witnessed confirmation bias silently derail million-dollar decisions — sometimes multiple traps compounding at once into what Charlie Munger called the <strong>"Lollapalooza effect,"</strong> a perfect storm of psychological forces that takes down even the sharpest minds.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Munger's legendary Harvard speech on the 25 causes of human misjudgment was the spark that lit this project. Brain Bugs is my way of putting these insights into the world — not just for boardrooms, but for anyone navigating careers, relationships, finances, and life decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal">
      Every bias has a pattern. Every pattern has an antidote. I'm building a library of <strong>mental models</strong> — practical thinking tools you can use to recognize these traps before they recognize you.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal about-mission">
      My mission is simple: help people see what they normally can't, so they can think clearly, decide wisely, and thrive.
