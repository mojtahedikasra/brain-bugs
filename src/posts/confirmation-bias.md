## The Detective Who Only Found What He Was Looking For

In 2002, Washington D.C. was terrorized by a series of sniper attacks. Ten people were killed. The entire metropolitan area was paralyzed with fear. Law enforcement launched one of the largest manhunts in American history.

Early in the investigation, a profile emerged: the sniper was likely a **white male, acting alone, driving a white van.** Every tip line call about a white van was prioritized. Every lead that didn't fit the profile was deprioritized.

The actual shooters? **Two Black men, traveling in a blue Chevrolet Caprice.** They were stopped by police *ten separate times* during the killing spree — and released every time. The profile had become a filter, and the filter blocked reality.

That's confirmation bias at work. And it's running in your head right now.

## How Your Brain Builds Its Own Reality

Confirmation bias is the tendency to **search for, interpret, favor, and remember information that confirms what you already believe** — while simultaneously ignoring, dismissing, or forgetting information that contradicts it.

It's not a conscious choice. It's a feature of how your brain processes information. Your brain is drowning in data every second, so it takes shortcuts: it prioritizes information that fits your existing mental models and quietly discards the rest.

The result? You don't see the world as it is. You see the world as you are.

## The Smartness Paradox

Here's what makes confirmation bias especially dangerous: **the smarter you are, the better you are at it.**

Intelligent people don't just have stronger beliefs — they have more sophisticated ways of defending them. They can construct more elaborate arguments, find more creative justifications, and rationalize more convincingly. High IQ doesn't protect you from confirmation bias; it supercharges it.

## The Antidote: The Steel Man

Most people are familiar with the "straw man" — a weak, distorted version of someone's argument that's easy to knock down. The antidote to confirmation bias is the opposite: the **Steel Man.**

Before dismissing an opposing view, **build the strongest possible version of it.** Make it better than the person presenting it could. Then — and only then — engage with it.

If you can't articulate why a smart, reasonable person might disagree with you, you don't understand the issue well enough to have a strong opinion about it.
