## The $400 Million Movie Nobody Wanted to Finish

In 1962, the British and French governments began building the Concorde — a supersonic passenger jet that would cut transatlantic flights in half. By the mid-1970s, it was clear the project was a financial disaster. Costs had ballooned. Airlines weren't buying. Every economic analysis said the same thing: **stop now.**

But they didn't stop. They couldn't. Too much had already been spent. Too many careers were attached. Too many headlines had been written. So they kept pouring money in — billions more — because walking away felt like admitting all that investment was wasted.

Economists now call this the **"Concorde Fallacy."** Most of us just call it being stuck.

## Your Brain's Worst Accounting Trick

The sunk cost fallacy is simple to describe and almost impossible to resist: **the more you've invested in something — time, money, emotion, identity — the harder it is to let go, even when letting go is clearly the right move.**

Your brain treats past investment as a reason to continue. But here's the thing those past investments have in common: they're gone. You can't un-spend the money. You can't un-live the years. The only question that matters is: *what's the best move from here?*

> "The cost of a thing is the amount of life you exchange for it." — Henry David Thoreau

## Where It Shows Up

This isn't just about big corporate disasters. The sunk cost trap infiltrates everyday life:

- **Relationships:** Staying in a bad relationship because "we've been together for five years" — as if time invested is a reason to invest more time in something that isn't working.
- **Careers:** Refusing to change careers because "I already have this degree" — even when the career makes you miserable.
- **Investments:** Holding a losing stock because selling would "make the loss real" — when the loss is already real, you just haven't acknowledged it.
- **Entertainment:** Finishing a terrible book or movie because "I've already read half of it."

The pattern is always the same: past investment distorts present decision-making.

## The Antidote: The Clean Slate Test

Here's a mental model that cuts through the noise. I call it the **Clean Slate Test:**

*If I were starting from scratch today — with no history, no investment, no baggage — would I choose this?*

Would you start dating this person today? Would you choose this career today? Would you buy this stock at today's price?

If the answer is no, the sunk cost is talking. And sunk costs are a terrible advisor.
