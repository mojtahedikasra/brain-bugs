## You're Ninety Minutes Into a Terrible Movie

The plot makes no sense. The lead actor appears to be sleepwalking through his lines. Your partner fell asleep twenty minutes ago, which honestly seems like the smart move.

You want to leave. You *should* leave. But here's the thing: you paid $15 for the ticket. Another $9 for popcorn. $7 for a soda that's now mostly ice. You drove thirty minutes to get here, in traffic, because you insisted on seeing it at the "good" theater with the reclining seats — seats that are now mocking you with their comfort as you suffer through act three.

**So you stay.**

Two hours later, you stumble out having lost not just your money, but an additional hour of your life. The movie was still terrible. The ending didn't redeem it. And now you're tired, cranky, and wondering why you didn't just cut your losses when you had the chance.

Welcome to the sunk cost fallacy — one of the most pervasive, expensive, and frankly *annoying* psychological traps that smart leaders, entrepreneurs, and decision-makers fall into every single day.

## The Bias Nobody Wants to Admit

The sunk cost fallacy is our tendency to continue investing in something — time, money, energy, emotion — simply because of what we've *already* invested, even when quitting would clearly be the smarter choice.

It shows up everywhere. In the relationship you know isn't working but you've been together for five years, so you might as well make it to ten. In the career you've outgrown but you can't leave because you've put in so much time climbing that particular ladder. In the business that's hemorrhaging money but you can't shut down because of everything you've sacrificed to build it.

The sunk cost fallacy whispers in your ear: *You've come this far. You can't give up now. Think of everything you've put in.*

And the voice sounds so reasonable. So logical. So *wise*. After all, quitting feels like losing. Walking away feels like admitting defeat.

**Here's the brutal truth: it's already gone.**

The movie ticket money isn't coming back whether you stay or leave. The five years in that relationship aren't refundable. The career capital you've built in the wrong field doesn't disappear the moment you pivot — but it also doesn't get any more valuable by staying stuck.

Sunk costs are called "sunk" for a reason. They've already sunk. They're at the bottom of the ocean. No amount of staying, waiting, or hoping will bring them back up.

## The Concorde: A $12 Billion Lesson in Throwing Good Money After Bad

No story illustrates this trap more dramatically than the Concorde — a case so iconic that economists named the bias after it.

In the 1960s, the governments of Britain and France had a dream: build a supersonic passenger jet that could cross the Atlantic in three hours. The Concorde was going to revolutionize air travel. The engineering would be cutting-edge. The prestige would be immeasurable. The money would surely follow.

Except it didn't.

By the mid-1970s — a full decade before the first commercial flight — both governments knew they had a problem. Development costs had ballooned far beyond projections. The Concorde burned fuel at **four times the rate** of conventional jets. Airlines weren't lining up to buy it. Almost no one wanted it except Air France and British Airways, who were essentially required to take delivery by their respective governments.

**A 1972 British government report concluded the project would never be commercially viable. Never.** The math didn't work, would never work, and continuing to pour money into development was economically irrational.

So what did Britain and France do? **They kept building.**

The argument was always the same: *we've invested too much to stop now.* Too much money. Too much national prestige. Too many jobs. Too many promises.

When the Concorde finally entered commercial service in 1976, total development costs exceeded **£1.3 billion** — roughly **£12 billion** in today's money. It never turned a profit. Not once. Not ever. Both airlines operated it at a loss for its entire twenty-seven-year service life, subsidized by taxpayers who had been promised a revolution and got instead a very expensive, very fast way to lose money.

The Concorde retired in 2003, having transported about 2.5 million passengers over nearly three decades — less than what a single modern wide-body jet can carry in a few years.

> When you hear someone in a boardroom say, "We can't kill this project now — think of what we've invested," they're flying a Concorde.

## When the Trap Gets Personal

The sunk cost trap doesn't just snare governments with unlimited budgets. It snares us — in the most personal and painful parts of our lives.

Research on relationship decision-making reveals a troubling pattern: people consistently stay in unhappy partnerships far longer than they should, largely because of the time they've already invested. In studies examining why people remain in unfulfilling relationships, "years together" consistently ranks among the top reasons — even when participants acknowledge they're unhappy and see little prospect for improvement.

Consider the pattern: a person knows the relationship isn't working. The connection that once felt electric now feels like obligation. They catch themselves fantasizing about what life might look like on the other side.

But leave? After all those years? After building a life together? After the inside jokes and shared memories and the apartment they decorated together?

*"I've put in too much to walk away now,"* they tell themselves. *"If I leave, those years will have been wasted."*

But here's what's hard to see from inside the trap: **those years are already spent.** They aren't sitting in an account somewhere, earning interest, redeemable if you stay long enough. They're gone. The only question is whether you want to add another year to the ledger — then another, then another — all in the hope of justifying the years that came before.

## The Psychology Behind the Trap

Why do smart people fall for the sunk cost trap so reliably? The answer lies in **loss aversion**, first documented by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their groundbreaking work on prospect theory.

Loss aversion is simple but profound: losses hurt more than equivalent gains feel good. **A lot more.** Research suggests that the psychological pain of losing $100 is roughly **twice as intense** as the pleasure of gaining $100. Some studies put the ratio even higher — as much as 2.5 to 1.

This asymmetry served our ancestors well. In a world of scarcity, where losing your food cache could mean death, it made evolutionary sense to weight losses more heavily than gains.

**But in the modern world, loss aversion often backfires.** It makes us cling to investments that are clearly failing. It keeps us in jobs that make us miserable. It traps us in strategies that stopped working years ago.

Here's the cognitive magic trick at the heart of it: our brains treat sunk costs as if they were still recoverable. We mentally classify them as "invested" rather than "spent," which makes walking away feel like actively losing something we still possess. But we don't possess it. It's gone.

Adding to the problem is **self-justification** — our deep psychological need to see our past decisions as rational. Admitting that we've sunk two years into a bad project — or ten years into a wrong career — requires admitting a prolonged, sustained, obvious-in-hindsight mistake. That's a hard pill to swallow. It's much easier to tell ourselves we just need a little more time, a little more money, a little more effort.

Spoiler alert: it usually doesn't pay off.

## The Antidote: Zero-Based Thinking

Fortunately, there's a simple mental model that cuts through the fog of sunk costs. It's called **Zero-Based Thinking**, a concept popularized by business strategist Brian Tracy, and it works like this:

Whenever you're weighing whether to continue something you've already invested in — a project, a relationship, a career, even a movie — ask yourself one question:

> **"Knowing what I now know, if I were not already in this situation, would I choose to enter it today?"**

If the answer is no — if you wouldn't start this project today, wouldn't take this job today, wouldn't begin this relationship today — then it's time to seriously consider getting out.

This question works because it strips away all the mental baggage of past investment. It forces you to evaluate the situation based solely on its present merits and future potential.

## How to Fight Back

**Set pre-commitment points.** Before starting a project, define the conditions under which you'll walk away. "If we don't hit X milestone by Y date, we shut it down." This takes the decision out of the heat of the moment, when sunk cost thinking is strongest.

**Seek outside perspective.** We're terrible at seeing our own sunk cost traps. A friend, mentor, or advisor who isn't emotionally invested can often see the situation clearly. Ask them: *"If you were me, starting from scratch today, would you do this?"*

**Reframe quitting as choosing.** You're not "giving up." You're choosing to redirect your resources to something better. The money you stop spending on the failing project is money you can invest in a promising one. The time you stop spending in a dead-end role is time you can invest in building the career you actually want.

**Practice on small stakes first.** Leave that bad movie. Put down that book you're not enjoying. Cancel that subscription you don't use. These low-stakes "quits" build the mental muscle for the bigger decisions when they come.

## The Real Question

The sunk cost fallacy seduces us with a promise that feels like wisdom: *don't waste what you've already invested.* But it's a false promise, because the investment is already spent. The money is gone. The time is gone. The only thing you can still control is what happens next.

Every day you stay in a failing situation because of what you've already put in is a day you're **choosing** to put in more. And that's a decision you're making right now, in the present, about the future — not a debt you owe to the past.

The next time you catch yourself thinking, "I've invested too much to quit now," stop. Take a breath. And ask the only question that matters:

**Knowing what I now know, would I start this today?**

If the answer is no, then it's not too late to leave.

It's just late enough.

> "The money is gone. The time is gone. The only thing you can control is what you do next."
