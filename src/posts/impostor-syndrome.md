## The Most Decorated Author Who Couldn't Believe She Deserved It

Maya Angelou published seven autobiographies, won three Grammys, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. After her eleventh book, she said:

*"I have written eleven books, but each time I think, 'Uh oh, they're going to find out now. I've run a game on everybody, and they're going to find me out.'"*

This wasn't false modesty. This was a genuine feeling — a deep, persistent conviction that her success was fraudulent, that she'd somehow tricked everyone, and that any moment now, the mask would slip.

She's not alone. An estimated **70% of people** experience impostor syndrome at some point in their lives. And it doesn't get better with success — it often gets worse.

## The Paradox of Competence

Impostor syndrome isn't about lacking ability. In fact, it's almost exclusively a condition of **people who are good at what they do.** The pattern looks like this:

You achieve something meaningful. Instead of internalizing the achievement ("I'm good at this"), you externalize it ("I got lucky," "the bar was low," "anyone could have done it"). Meanwhile, every mistake and failure gets internalized deeply ("that's the real me").

Over time, you build an upside-down picture of yourself: your failures define you, and your successes are flukes.

## Why It Gets Worse at the Top

The higher you climb, the more sophisticated your peers become. You're no longer the smartest person in the room — and your brain interprets that as evidence that you don't belong in the room at all.

This is the **competence gap illusion:** you can see all of your own weaknesses (because you live inside your own head), but you can only see other people's polished exteriors. You're comparing your behind-the-scenes footage to everyone else's highlight reel.

## The Antidote: The Evidence Log

Your brain keeps a biased record. It highlights failures and dismisses wins. So you need to keep a better record — externally.

The **Evidence Log** is simple: maintain a running list of your accomplishments, positive feedback, and moments where you genuinely performed well. Not a gratitude journal — an *evidence file.*

When impostor syndrome whispers "you're not good enough," open the log. Don't argue with the feeling — just read the evidence. Your brain will try to dismiss each item individually. That's fine. The cumulative weight is what matters.

The feeling may never fully disappear. But with evidence, you can learn to hear it and move anyway.
