## Look Down at Your Keyboard

Go ahead — look at the top row of letters. **Q-W-E-R-T-Y.** You've probably never questioned that arrangement. It's just how keyboards are.

But here's something worth sitting with: that layout was designed in **1873** by a man named Christopher Sholes, and it wasn't designed for you. It was designed for a machine. Specifically, a mechanical typewriter whose metal arms would jam together when keys were struck too quickly. Sholes scattered common letter pairs across the keyboard to force typists to *slow down* — giving those metal arms time to untangle before the next letter arrived.

**The machine that needed this workaround hasn't existed for decades.**

The last mechanical typewriter that could physically jam rolled off an assembly line before most of us were born. And yet here we are — in an age of touchscreens and voice recognition — still typing on a layout optimized for a problem that no longer exists.

Better alternatives have been around for almost a century. In 1936, August Dvorak created a layout that places the most common letters where your fingers naturally rest. Studies found that QWERTY typists' fingers travel up to **20 miles** during a workday. On a Dvorak keyboard? **About one mile.** Seventy percent of your typing happens on the home row instead of constant reaching.

So why isn't everyone using Dvorak?

Because everyone uses QWERTY. Schools teach it. Offices provide it. Jobs assume it. The cost of switching — retraining your muscle memory, being slower for months — outweighs the benefit for any one person, even though we'd all be better off if we switched together.

> We are trapped by history. Not because QWERTY is good, but because QWERTY is *there*.

This is **status quo bias.** And if you think it only applies to keyboards, I have some uncomfortable news about the rest of your life.

## The Bias Nobody Feels

Status quo bias is our tendency to prefer the current state of affairs **simply because it's the current state of affairs.** Change feels risky. Staying put feels safe. Even when the evidence clearly favors change — even when the current situation is objectively making us worse off — we find reasons to hold on.

Economists William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser documented this in 1988. They gave people choices between investment portfolios, job candidates, and policy options. Sometimes the choices were presented neutrally. Other times, one option was labeled as the "current" choice.

**The result was consistent:** when something was framed as the status quo, people chose it far more often — even when alternatives were objectively better.

What makes this bias so dangerous is that it doesn't *feel* like a bias at all. It feels like *not* making a decision. Like staying neutral. Staying safe. But sticking with the status quo **is** a decision — it's a choice to accept whatever you have, even when something better is available.

## The Company That Had Everything and Lost It All

No story illustrates this more painfully than Sears.

In 1969, Sears was the **largest retailer in the world.** Its sales represented one percent of the entire U.S. economy. And the engine behind it was the Sears catalog — a system where customers browsed products from home, placed orders, and had purchases delivered to their door.

Sears had massive customer data. A nationwide distribution network. Enormous vendor relationships. **It was Amazon before Amazon existed.**

By the early 1990s, the catalog division was bleeding money. So Sears made what seemed logical: they killed the catalog. They didn't just stop printing it — they dismantled the *entire* infrastructure. The distribution centers. The customer databases. The systems that made home shopping possible. All of it, gone.

**One year later, Jeff Bezos launched Amazon.**

Sears didn't die because they lacked the capabilities to compete in e-commerce. They had exactly those capabilities — and they *dismantled* them. They even launched one of the first consumer online services in the 1980s. They invented in-store pickup for online orders. They understood the technology.

They just couldn't bring themselves to abandon their stores — the status quo that felt safe, familiar, and *current.*

> Sears thought they were choosing stability. They were actually choosing extinction.

Sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Amazon is now worth nearly **two trillion dollars.**

## The Defaults Running Your Life

The power of the status quo shows up everywhere when you start looking.

In countries where citizens are **automatically enrolled** as organ donors (and must opt out), donation rates exceed **90 percent.** In countries where people must opt in? Rates sit around **15-20 percent.** Same moral values. Same understanding that donation saves lives. Different default. Different outcome.

The same thing happens with retirement savings. When companies auto-enroll employees in 401(k) plans, participation jumps from **40 percent to over 90 percent.** Same employees. Same plan. Same money. The only difference is which box was pre-checked.

**Most of us never examine the boxes that were checked for us.**

## How to Fight Back

The antidote to status quo bias isn't reckless change — it's **conscious evaluation.**

**Audit your defaults.** Look at the subscriptions you're paying for, the role you're in, the city you're living in, the relationships you're maintaining. Ask honestly: *if I were starting fresh today, would I choose this?* If the answer is no, the status quo is costing you something.

**Treat inaction as a choice.** When you decide not to change something, you're not avoiding a decision — you're making one. Make it consciously. If you can't articulate good reasons for staying, that's a signal.

**Apply the clean slate test.** Imagine your current situation didn't exist. If someone offered it to you today — this job, this team, this arrangement — would you take it? If not, you're staying because of inertia, not because it's the best option.

**Design better defaults for yourself.** If defaults are that powerful, use them intentionally. Automate savings. Pre-commit to decisions. Make the better choice the easier choice.

## The Real Question

Every "way things are" started as a "new way of doing things." QWERTY was an innovation in 1873. The Sears catalog was revolutionary in 1888. At some point, someone *chose* these things — and now we're trapped by those choices, unable to update them even when we know better.

**Change is coming whether you choose it or not.** The only real question is whether you'll choose your changes deliberately — or have them forced upon you by a world that doesn't wait for permission.

> "The devil you know isn't always better than the angel you don't. Sometimes the devil you know is just a devil."

And sometimes the only way forward is to stop clinging to what you have and reach for something better — even when reaching feels harder than holding on.
